# Strimzi ArgoCD Kafdrop Application

This is a bare minimum ArgoCD Application to get Strimzi deployed along with a Kafdrop instance.

## Prerequisites

* Have a cluster-wide https://operatorhub.io/operator/strimzi-kafka-operator installed on your OpenShift 4.3+ cluster.
* Use the namespace KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER env variable in the kafdrop deployment to reflect the location of your
kafka bootstrap servers

## Observed Issues

1. it seems like the Strimzi Operator is having problems with DNS name resolution of domainnames generated by
StatefulSets on OpenShift 4.3.2. This problem was not observed on OpenShift 4.3.8
